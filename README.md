## Description 
This application is a useful employee tracker that can be used by management within a company to keep track of current departments, roles, and personnel. It was created using Node.js and establishes a connection to a MySQL server database for communication within the terminal. The SQL queries used to create the database are located in the schema.sql file and the queries to join the tables are in the joins.sql file. Once the database is created and the connection is established the user can then run the server using the node server.js command to view, add, update, or delete the data in the database through the terminal.
